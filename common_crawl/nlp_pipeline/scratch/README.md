# scratch

This folder contains personal and exploratory notebooks used for prototyping and testing.  
Files here were primarily used to test Common Crawl data processing and to prototype the production pipeline before deployment.  
By default, notebooks in 'scratch' are not committed to Git, as this folder is listed in `.gitignore`.

## Purpose

- Experiment with data extraction and transformation workflows.
- Validate approaches for handling Common Crawl datasets.
- Prototype and iterate on production pipeline logic in a safe, isolated environment.

## Notes

- Contents are not intended for production use.
- Notebooks may be incomplete or contain experimental code.
- For finalized workflows, refer to the main pipeline directories.
